# NimRL

NimRL lets a Reinforcement Learning agent learn to play the game of Nim
on boards of 4, 5 or 6 heaps using the Q-learning or SARSA algorithms.
Training can be done against a smart or random opponent (NimTraining.py) 
or the agents can train against each other (AgentvsAgent.py).
Performance is measured against the smart agent.
